      "Nice try, students. But seriously, only verified teachers get the magic wand.",

    question: "What if I forget my password?",
    answer:
      "First, try 'password123' because let's be honest, that was probably it. If that fails, we have a fancy 'Forgot Password' button that's been waiting for its moment to shine.",

    question: "What if I fail all the quizzes?",

      "Then you’ll join our exclusive “Kwizzy’s Humble Learners Club.” It’s not a real club, but hey, failure is the first step to becoming a quiz master!",

      " Let’s just say you might “accidentally” miss your bedtime. But hey, learning is productive, right?",

    question: "Can Kwizzy help me impress my crush?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Just casually mention your latest quiz score and watch the sparks fly. Or not. We can’t guarantee anything.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cheat?",
    answer:
      "Well, Kwizzy doesn’t judge… but remember, cheaters never prosper. Plus, the only person you’re fooling is your own ego. We recommend winning with your brains, not your browser tabs!",
